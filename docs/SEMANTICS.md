# wirelog Semantic Model

This document records observable semantic decisions in the wirelog
engine. Each section is an ADR-style entry: a short statement of the
rule, the rationale, and the public-API surfaces that hold it today.

Each entry is tagged with its **Status**:

- **Stable** — a contract the engine honors across a major version.
  Changes go through a deprecation cycle in `docs/MIGRATION.md`.
- **Current** — describes what the engine does today on the path to
  1.0. May evolve before 1.0 GA based on review or implementation
  realities. See `stable-release-plan.md` for the trajectory.

Until 1.0 ships, expect most entries to be **Current**.

## Inline `.dl` facts (Status: Current)

### Rule

Inline ground facts written in a `.dl` source (e.g.
`role_permission("wr.system_admin", "wr.policy.write").`) are part of
the EDB. After parsing the program, the engine seeds these facts into
the columnar session as base rows exactly once, on the first
plan/session build:

- via `wirelog_easy_open` / any `wirelog_easy_*` lazy entry point: at first
  build, before any host delta callback can be installed.
- via the CLI driver: at the same point in the
  `wl_session_create` → `wl_session_load_facts` →
  `wl_session_load_input_files` sequence.

Snapshots returned by `wirelog_easy_snapshot()` and IDB rows derived by the
optimizer pipeline therefore observe inline facts on the first call,
without any host action.

### Z-set semantics for host insert / remove

`wirelog_easy_insert()` and `wirelog_easy_remove()` are differential operations
on the session's z-set state:

- `wirelog_easy_insert(R, row)` raises the multiplicity of `row` in `R`
  by `+1`.
- `wirelog_easy_remove(R, row)` lowers it by `-1`.

If a host inserts a row that is already present from the inline-fact
seed, the row's multiplicity becomes `+2`. A subsequent
`wirelog_easy_remove()` of the same row leaves multiplicity `+1`; the row
remains observable in snapshots until both copies are retracted.

This matches differential dataflow conventions and is consistent with
`wl_session_*` (internal) and the future `wirelog_session_*` advanced
surface (see `stable-release-plan.md` §3).

### How a host can mirror static facts safely

Two patterns are supported:

1. **Do nothing** — the engine seeds inline facts on its own. The host
   is free to insert *only* the facts it wants to add at runtime.
2. **Pre-check via `wirelog_program_get_facts`** — a host that needs
   to know which inline facts are present can iterate them and skip
   matching rows in its mirror logic. This avoids the +2 multiplicity
   case if the host design demands set semantics.

### What is *not* promised

- The relative *order* of inline-fact rows visible in a snapshot is
  not stable across releases. Hosts must not depend on positional
  ordering.
- The *identity* of intern ids assigned to symbols in inline facts is
  not stable across runs of the same program.
- Multiplicities other than the basic z-set arithmetic above (e.g.
  weighted aggregates) are subject to the engine's
  multiplicity-tracking rules, not promised by this document.

### Cross-facade parity (Status: Current)

`wirelog/wirelog-advanced.h` ships the public `wirelog_session_*` surface
as the advanced peer of `wirelog_easy`. Both facades share this exact
semantic model: open-time inline-fact seeding, z-set host insert/remove,
optional pre-check via `wirelog_program_get_facts`. This is the contract
that prevents behavioral drift between the easy and advanced surfaces.

Internal `wl_session_*` and `wl_compute_backend_t` remain private. The
advanced API exposes backend selection through the
`wirelog_backend_kind_t` enum (`DEFAULT`, `COLUMNAR`); new backends
will appear as additive enum values in future minor releases.

## v0.40 API audit closure (Status: Current)

The v0.40 API audit (epic #680, Risk-C and Blocker-B series catalogued
in `stable-release-plan.md` §1.3) drove a sweep of the public-API
surface against `AGENTS.md:17-20` (public uses `wirelog_*` /
`WIRELOG_*`, internal uses `wl_*` / `WL_*`).  Every concrete open
question raised during the audit pass has been resolved through a
landed PR; this section records the closures so v1.0 readers can
reconstruct the reasoning.

### Decisions taken

| Question | Decision | Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| `wirelog/io/io_adapter.h` classification | Public, with full `wirelog_io_*` rename + ABI version 1u→2u | #762 (replaces audit-era #706) |
| `wl_easy` facade prefix | Renamed to `wirelog_easy_*`; file moved to `wirelog/wirelog-easy.h` | #756 |
| `WL_STR_FN_*` enum constants | Renamed to `WIRELOG_STR_FN_*` | #757 |
| `wl_on_delta_fn` / `wl_on_tuple_fn` callback typedefs | Renamed to `wirelog_on_*_fn` | #758 |
| `WL_PUBLIC` export-attribute macro | Renamed to `WIRELOG_PUBLIC` | #759 |
| `wl_intern_t` typedef on `wirelog/wirelog.h` | Renamed to `wirelog_intern_t` (internal `struct wl_intern` tag retained) | #760 |
| Future-drift prevention | `scripts/ci/check-public-prefix.py` (suite `abi`) refuses any `wl_*` / `WL_*` symbol on a public installed header | #761 |
| Public-header SSoT 3-way verification | `scripts/ci/check-public-header-surface.py` already shipped at #705; PR #770 added the standalone-include compile matrix that closes Blocker B2 | #689 (B2) |
| Symbol-visibility default | `gnu_symbol_visibility: 'hidden'`; `WIRELOG_API` annotation gates the dynamic-symbol table (alias of `WIRELOG_PUBLIC`; see `wirelog/wirelog-export.h`); SOVERSION=1 decoupled from `project_version` | #733 (K0/K1/K2), #782 |

### What remains open

No audit-era "binding decision required" notes remain unresolved at
the time of writing.  The audit residue in `.omc/plans/issue-706-brief.md`
references its own forward-link to #762; subsequent ABI work (libabigail
manifest, branch-protection, signing) is tracked under v0.41+ blockers
(#690 B3) and the v1.0.0-rc and GA epics, not under the v0.40 audit.
