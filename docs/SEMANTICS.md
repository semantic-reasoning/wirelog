# wirelog Semantic Model

This document records observable semantic decisions in the wirelog
engine. Each section is an ADR-style entry: a short statement of the
rule, the rationale, and the public-API surfaces that hold it today.

Each entry is tagged with its **Status**:

- **Stable** — a contract the engine honors across a major version.
  Changes go through a deprecation cycle in `docs/MIGRATION.md`.
- **Current** — describes what the engine does today on the path to
  1.0. May evolve before 1.0 GA based on review or implementation
  realities. See `stable-release-plan.md` for the trajectory.

Until 1.0 ships, expect most entries to be **Current**.

## Inline `.dl` facts (Status: Current)

### Rule

Inline ground facts written in a `.dl` source (e.g.
`role_permission("wr.system_admin", "wr.policy.write").`) are part of
the EDB. After parsing the program, the engine seeds these facts into
the columnar session as base rows exactly once, on the first
plan/session build:

- via `wirelog_easy_open` / any `wirelog_easy_*` lazy entry point: at first
  build, before any host delta callback can be installed.
- via the CLI driver: at the same point in the
  `wl_session_create` → `wl_session_load_facts` →
  `wl_session_load_input_files` sequence.

Snapshots returned by `wirelog_easy_snapshot()` and IDB rows derived by the
optimizer pipeline therefore observe inline facts on the first call,
without any host action.

### Z-set semantics for host insert / remove

`wirelog_easy_insert()` and `wirelog_easy_remove()` are differential operations
on the session's z-set state:

- `wirelog_easy_insert(R, row)` raises the multiplicity of `row` in `R`
  by `+1`.
- `wirelog_easy_remove(R, row)` lowers it by `-1`.

If a host inserts a row that is already present from the inline-fact
seed, the row's multiplicity becomes `+2`. A subsequent
`wirelog_easy_remove()` of the same row leaves multiplicity `+1`; the row
remains observable in snapshots until both copies are retracted.

This matches differential dataflow conventions and is consistent with
`wl_session_*` (internal) and the future `wirelog_session_*` advanced
surface (see `stable-release-plan.md` §3).

### How a host can mirror static facts safely

Two patterns are supported:

1. **Do nothing** — the engine seeds inline facts on its own. The host
   is free to insert *only* the facts it wants to add at runtime.
2. **Pre-check via `wirelog_program_get_facts`** — a host that needs
   to know which inline facts are present can iterate them and skip
   matching rows in its mirror logic. This avoids the +2 multiplicity
   case if the host design demands set semantics.

### What is *not* promised

- The relative *order* of inline-fact rows visible in a snapshot is
  not stable across releases. Hosts must not depend on positional
  ordering.
- The *identity* of intern ids assigned to symbols in inline facts is
  not stable across runs of the same program.
- Multiplicities other than the basic z-set arithmetic above (e.g.
  weighted aggregates) are subject to the engine's
  multiplicity-tracking rules, not promised by this document.

### Cross-facade parity (Status: Current)

`wirelog/wirelog-advanced.h` ships the public `wirelog_session_*` surface
as the advanced peer of `wirelog_easy`. Both facades share this exact
semantic model: open-time inline-fact seeding, z-set host insert/remove,
optional pre-check via `wirelog_program_get_facts`. This is the contract
that prevents behavioral drift between the easy and advanced surfaces.

Internal `wl_session_*` and `wl_compute_backend_t` remain private. The
advanced API exposes backend selection through the
`wirelog_backend_kind_t` enum (`DEFAULT`, `COLUMNAR`); new backends
will appear as additive enum values in future minor releases.

#### Parity audit (v0.41 / #785)

The cross-facade contract is mechanically pinned by a per-test
parity rule: every `test_*` function in
`tests/test_wirelog_easy.c` is either (a) **paired** with a
same-named function in `tests/test_wirelog_advanced.c` or
(b) **annotated** with a `/* PARITY: ... */` block-comment on the
line(s) immediately preceding the declaration, naming the
structural reason no advanced analogue exists (typically the
easy facade carries a convenience surface -- `*_sym` variadics,
`wirelog_easy_open_opts_t`, `wirelog_easy_print_delta` -- that
has no `wirelog_session_*` counterpart).  Enforced by
`scripts/ci/check-test-parity.py` (`meson test --suite abi:test_parity`).

The rule is per-test, not a numeric ratio: future additions on
either side cannot silently regress parity.  Either pair the new
test or annotate the easy declaration with the structural reason.

**Reverse parity is intentionally asymmetric.**  Advanced-only
tests (`test_create_columnar`, `test_create_invalid_backend`,
`test_null_safety` for backend selection) do not back-port to the
easy facade -- the easy surface hides backend selection by
design.  The asymmetry is recorded here so future maintainers do
not assume symmetric coverage.

## Recursive aggregation residue (Status: Future)

Tracked under #692.  Target: residue = 0 in Milestone v0.43.

### Definition

Residue is the count of `'not yet implemented'` markers and disabled
conformance tests in `tests/test_recursive_agg*.c` that prevent
recursive aggregation programs (CC-min, SSSP-max, count-stratified)
from producing semantically correct output at workers in {1, 4, 8, 16}.

### Current state (as of v0.42)

- **Conformance harness disabled**: `tests/test_recursive_agg.c`,
  `tests/test_recursive_agg_cc_min.c`, and
  `tests/test_recursive_agg_sssp_max.c` are disabled in
  `tests/meson.build:184-198, 2190-2194`.  The harness depended on the
  DD/Rust FFI backend, which has been removed.  No replacement fixtures
  have been ported to the columnar backend.
- **Columnar dispatch state** at `wirelog/columnar/eval.c:241-288`:
  - `col_op_reduce` (`wirelog/columnar/ops.c:6090`) IS wired into the
    recursive dispatch switch (`WL_PLAN_OP_REDUCE` case at
    `eval.c:267-269`).  Conformance for recursive monotone aggregation
    (MIN/MAX) cannot run today only because the harness in
    `tests/test_recursive_agg*.c` is disabled.
  - `col_op_reduce_weighted` (`wirelog/columnar/ops.c:6200`) is built
    but NOT dispatched (no `WL_PLAN_OP_REDUCE_WEIGHTED:` case in the
    switch).  Weighted reductions inside `iterate()` cannot execute.
- **count-stratified scope asymmetry**: count-stratified aggregation
  appears in the #692 issue body but is absent from the acceptance
  criteria, and no test fixtures exist.

### Path to residue = 0

1. **Phase 2B prerequisite**: semi-naive Delta-R for non-aggregation
   recursion (#735, #809, #810, #811) must land first.  Phase 2B covers
   non-agg recursion; REDUCE-inside-iterate is a separate concern.
2. **v0.43 work**: re-enable the conformance harness against the
   columnar backend; add a `WL_PLAN_OP_REDUCE_WEIGHTED:` case to wire
   `col_op_reduce_weighted` into the recursive dispatch switch; add
   count-stratified fixtures.

v0.42 narrowed exit criterion: "non-agg recursion residue = 0" via
Phase 2B sub-issues (#809/#810/#811).  Recursive aggregation residue = 0
carries to v0.43 under #692.

## v0.40 API audit closure (Status: Current)

The v0.40 API audit (epic #680, Risk-C and Blocker-B series catalogued
in `stable-release-plan.md` §1.3) drove a sweep of the public-API
surface against `AGENTS.md:17-20` (public uses `wirelog_*` /
`WIRELOG_*`, internal uses `wl_*` / `WL_*`).  Every concrete open
question raised during the audit pass has been resolved through a
landed PR; this section records the closures so v1.0 readers can
reconstruct the reasoning.

### Decisions taken

| Question | Decision | Anchor |
|---|---|---|
| `wirelog/io/io_adapter.h` classification | Public, with full `wirelog_io_*` rename + ABI version 1u→2u | #762 (replaces audit-era #706) |
| `wl_easy` facade prefix | Renamed to `wirelog_easy_*`; file moved to `wirelog/wirelog-easy.h` | #756 |
| `WL_STR_FN_*` enum constants | Renamed to `WIRELOG_STR_FN_*` | #757 |
| `wl_on_delta_fn` / `wl_on_tuple_fn` callback typedefs | Renamed to `wirelog_on_*_fn` | #758 |
| `WL_PUBLIC` export-attribute macro | Renamed to `WIRELOG_PUBLIC` | #759 |
| `wl_intern_t` typedef on `wirelog/wirelog.h` | Renamed to `wirelog_intern_t` (internal `struct wl_intern` tag retained) | #760 |
| Future-drift prevention | `scripts/ci/check-public-prefix.py` (suite `abi`) refuses any `wl_*` / `WL_*` symbol on a public installed header | #761 |
| Public-header SSoT 3-way verification | `scripts/ci/check-public-header-surface.py` already shipped at #705; PR #770 added the standalone-include compile matrix that closes Blocker B2 | #689 (B2) |
| Symbol-visibility default | `gnu_symbol_visibility: 'hidden'`; `WIRELOG_API` annotation gates the dynamic-symbol table (alias of `WIRELOG_PUBLIC`; see `wirelog/wirelog-export.h`); SOVERSION=1 decoupled from `project_version` | #733 (K0/K1/K2), #782 |

### What remains open

No audit-era "binding decision required" notes remain unresolved at
the time of writing.  The audit residue in `.omc/plans/issue-706-brief.md`
references its own forward-link to #762; subsequent ABI work (libabigail
manifest, branch-protection, signing) is tracked under v0.41+ blockers
(#690 B3) and the v1.0.0-rc and GA epics, not under the v0.40 audit.
